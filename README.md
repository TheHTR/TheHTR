## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm from Brazil, I'm studying systems analysis and development!
<br>
I'm here to learning something, practice and get a money if possible ðŸ˜…
<br>
I'm learning Data Bank, Web Programming and SQL
<br>
Fun fact: I don't know how to do a presetation, and my english is not too good, so sorry for some grammatical mistakes!
<br>
Was it good ðŸ˜…?
